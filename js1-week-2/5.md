You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.

it compares the actual returned output of the sum function, with an expected value (42)
it checks that the sum function with inputs (arguments) 10 & 32 returns 42

Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a function `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

expect(isMultipleOfTen(80).toBe(true));
